## 项目概述
本项目是作者首次参与的Kaggle竞赛代码仓库，记录从基线模型到优化方案的完整迭代过程。通过本仓库您可以：
- 🚀 复现不同阶段的模型方案（v1.0 ~ vN.0）
- 📊 查看我的数据预处理、特征工程演进路线
- 🤝 ​**欢迎通过[Issues]提交优化建议**


## 项目架构
BadVersion:一开始作者尝试通过CNN捕获特征,采用了kaggle上基于cnn的baseline,并基于此进行优化,但发现效果并不理想
Pro:作者复现了RibonanzaNet的代码,并基于此框架进行优化​

### 比赛背景
> RNA is vital to life’s most essential processes, but despite its significance, predicting its 3D structure is still difficult. Deep learning breakthroughs like AlphaFold have transformed protein structure prediction, but progress with RNA has been much slower due to limited data and evaluation methods.
This competition builds on recent advances, like the deep learning foundation model RibonanzaNet, which emerged from a prior Kaggle competition. Now, you’ll take on the next challenge—predicting RNA’s full 3D structure.
Your work could push RNA-based medicine forward, making treatments like cancer immunotherapies and CRISPR gene editing more accessible and effective. More fundamentally, your work may be the key step in illuminating the folds and functions of natural RNA molecules, which have been called the 'dark matter of biology'.
This competition is made possible through a worldwide collaborative effort including the organizers, experimental RNA structural biologists, and predictors of the CASP16 and RNA-Puzzles competitions; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; the Institute of Protein Design; and Stanford University School of Medicine.
