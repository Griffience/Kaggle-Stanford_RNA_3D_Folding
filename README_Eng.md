## 项目概述
This repository documents my first Kaggle competition journey, including baseline model implementations, optimization strategies, and iterative improvements. Key features: 
- 🚀 ​**Reproducible Code**: Access optimized model implementations.   
- 📊 ​**Data Pipeline Evolution**: Track preprocessing and feature engineering workflows.   
- 🤝 ​**Collaboration Welcome**: Submit suggestions via email: 2376305851@qq.com  


### Competition Background
> RNA plays a vital role in essential biological processes, yet predicting its 3D structure remains challenging. While breakthroughs like AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, RNA progress has lagged due to limited data and evaluation methods.  
> This competition builds on RibonanzaNet (a foundation model from prior Kaggle contests) to predict RNA's full 3D structure. Successful models could advance RNA-based therapies (e.g., CRISPR, cancer immunotherapies) and decode RNA's functional "dark matter."  
> ​**Competition Type**: Featured Code Competition    
> ​**Technical Focus**: Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Biophysics    
> ​**Evaluation Metric**: TM-score
